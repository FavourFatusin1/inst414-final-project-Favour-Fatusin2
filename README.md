Credit card fraud is a pervasive issue that causes substantial financial damage across various sectors. A critical aspect of this problem is understanding how fraud rates vary by geographic location, particularly in more populated and metropolitan areas. Financial institutions need to address the higher incidence of fraud in these regions to effectively protect their customers and reduce losses.
In densely populated and metropolitan areas, the volume of financial transactions is significantly higher due to the concentration of people and economic activity. This increased transaction volume can lead to a higher number of fraud incidents simply because there are more opportunities for fraudulent activities. Additionally, metropolitan areas often have more sophisticated fraud schemes targeting their large, diverse population, further exacerbating the problem.
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify high-risk credit card transactions in real-
time based on historical transaction data and customer profiles. I used two real data sets on credit card
transaction from the past. As someone wotkng at a bank it is good that you ensure safety and security to the people who are using your banking ssytem. Using data science, you can analyze the problem, and come up with solutions to the problem based on the data analyzed and created.
